I'm a political scientist and freelance policy and data analyst,
currently also teaching classes at the Central European University
(Vienna). As a researcher, my main interests relate to the European
Union, specifically its judicial and environmental politics. I work
with whatever methods are most promising for any given puzzle,
including qualitative (QCA, process-tracing) and quantitative
(surveys, regression analysis) approaches.

I have worked at the University of Vienna's [Centre for European
Integration Research](https://eif.univie.ac.at), the [Danube University
Krems](https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en/university/faculties/business-globalization/departments/european-policy-study-of-democracy.html),
the [University of
Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/politikwissenschaft/index.html.en),
the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/), and the
[Jacobs University Bremen](https://www.jacobs-university.de/). I
graduated with a PhD in political science from the [Bremen Graduate
School of Social Sciences (BIGSSS)](https://www.bigsss-bremen.de) on
EU environmental politics under the constraints of joint-decision
making. The resulting book ["The EU's Green
Dynamism"](./publication/green-dynamism/) was published with ECPR
Press/Rowman & Littlefield.

I also rolled pretty good vegan
[maki](http://www.sushikomomo.ca/) in Montr√©al.
