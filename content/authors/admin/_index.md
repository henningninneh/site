I'm a research associate at the [Department for European Policy and the Study of Democracy](https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en/university/faculties/business-globalization/departments/european-policy-study-of-democracy/) and [Regioparl](https://www.regioparl.com) at the Danube University Krems. My research deals mainly with issues of policy-making within the European system of multi-level governance, with a substantive focus on European judicial politics as well as climate and environment policy.

Before starting at the Department of Political Science, I worked at
the [Centre for European Integration
Research](http://eif.univie.ac.at) (EIF, Uni Vienna). I was trained as
political scientist at the Bremen Graduate School of Social Sciences
(BIGSSS), where I graduated with a doctoral thesis on EU environmental
politics under the constraints of joint-decision making. The resulting
book "The EU's Green Dynamism" was published with ECPR Press/Rowman &
Littlefield.

I also rolled pretty good vegan
[maki](http://www.sushimomo.ca/?lang=en) in Montréal.
