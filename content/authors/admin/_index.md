I'm a research associate at the [Department for European Policy
and the Study of
Democracy (DED)](https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en/university/faculties/business-globalization/departments/european-policy-study-of-democracy/)
and [Regioparl](https://www.regioparl.com) at the Danube University
Krems. My research deals mainly with issues of policy-making within
the European system of multi-level governance, with a substantive
focus on European judicial politics as well as climate and environment
policy.

Before starting at the DED, I worked at the [Department of Political
Science](https://www.uibk.ac.at/politikwissenschaft/index.html.en) at
the University Innsbruck and at the [Centre for European Integration
Research (EIF)](http://eif.univie.ac.at) at the University Vienna. I
was trained as political scientist at the [Bremen Graduate School of
Social Sciences (BIGSSS)](https://www.bigsss-bremen.de), where I
graduated with a doctoral thesis on EU environmental politics under
the constraints of joint-decision making. The resulting book ["The
EU's Green Dynamism"](./publication/green-dynamism/) was published
with ECPR Press/Rowman & Littlefield.

I also rolled pretty good vegan
[maki](http://www.sushimomo.ca/?lang=en) in Montr√©al.
