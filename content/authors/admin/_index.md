I'm a political scientist at the [Centre for European Integration
Research](https://eif.univie.ac.at/) of the Department of Political
Science at the University of Vienna. At present, my research deals
mainly with the judges at the Court of Justice of the European Union,
more specifically with their appointment and judicial preferences. To
study this topic, I am setting up an expert survey based on generous
funding by the Austrian Science Fund, FWF.

More generally, I am interested in issues related to policy-making
within European multi-level governance. Next to judicial politics, my
substantive focus has been mostly on climate and environmental
policy and the single market. I am also affiliated with the
[Regioparl](http://www.regioparl.com) Project that examines the role
of regional parliaments in the EU.

I have worked at the [Danube University
Krems](https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en/university/faculties/business-globalization/departments/european-policy-study-of-democracy.html),
the [University of
Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/politikwissenschaft/index.html.en),
the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/), and the
[Jacobs University Bremen](https://www.jacobs-university.de/). I
graduated with a PhD in political science from the [Bremen Graduate
School of Social Sciences (BIGSSS)](https://www.bigsss-bremen.de) on
EU environmental politics under the constraints of joint-decision
making. The resulting book ["The EU's Green
Dynamism"](./publication/green-dynamism/) was published with ECPR
Press/Rowman & Littlefield.

I also rolled pretty good vegan
[maki](http://www.sushikomomo.ca/) in Montr√©al.
