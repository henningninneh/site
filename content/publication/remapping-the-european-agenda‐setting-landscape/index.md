abstract: In the European Union, agenda‐setting is formally centralized with the
  European Commission. During the last decade since the Lisbon Treaty, however,
  this agenda‐setting monopoly was challenged by other institutions against the
  backdrop of Treaty change, intergovernmental crisis management,
  politicization, and more informal legislative bargaining. This symposium
  therefore surveys the emerging agenda‐setting powers of the EU's other main
  institutional actors, in their relation to the Commission. The introduction
  provides a conceptual framework, distinguishing between procedural and
  discursive agenda‐setting power, as well as gate‐keeping power and
  agenda‐leadership. Based on this typology, we argue that not only the European
  Council (agenda‐leadership) but even the Court of Justice of the EU
  (procedural agenda‐setting) and the European Parliament (discursive
  agenda‐setting) gained more influence on policy‐decisions through their
  informal agenda‐setting activities. The landscape has thus become variegated,
  and the Commission, although remaining centre stage, now depends more strongly
  on inter‐institutional alliances.
