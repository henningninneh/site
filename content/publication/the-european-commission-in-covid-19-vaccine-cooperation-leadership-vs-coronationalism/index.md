abstract: During the first weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, European Union (EU)
  member states competed over scarce countermeasures. Regarding vaccines, a few
  member states launched exclusive joint endeavours, yet eventually, the EU
  centralised vaccine provisioning. The EU’s external vaccine diplomacy
  proceeded almost inversely. After stepping into the breach in global health
  governance, European leadership faltered and global collaboration progressed
  more slowly. This article explores Europe’s diverging trajectories in the
  regional and global provisioning of Covid-19 vaccines. Focussing on the
  European Commission’s leadership, we investigate to what extent it promoted
  regional and international cooperation and with what success. We also explain
  which factors enabled and constrained Commission leadership. Employing a
  controlled comparison and process tracing, we find that Commission leadership
  was more extensive and impactful in regional than in global vaccine
  provisioning. Member state support was the main enabling condition. Without
  support, institutional capacity and resources were insufficient for impactful
  leadership.
