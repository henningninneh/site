  This chapter examines how the EU transforms political issues and demands
  into policy decisions. Due to its multi-faceted nature, European
  environmental policy making cannot be captured fully by any single
  theory. Instead, it is shaped by a combination of different processes,
  each of which may dominate at certain times and for particular issues.
  In intergovernmental policy making, decisions revolve around
  environmental leader and laggard states, with outcomes being determined
  by their respective bargaining power and the use of conflict management
  techniques. In supranational policy making, the European Parliament and
  the Commission each aim to raise the level of protection above the
  lowest common denominator of member state positions. Finally, ever more
  environmental policy decisions are adopted via a transnational process
  in which the Commission and expert officials are relatively loosely
  coupled to their domestic governments.
